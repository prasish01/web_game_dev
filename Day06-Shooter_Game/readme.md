# Raven Hunter (JavaScript + Canvas)

A lightweight 2D shooting game built using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. Ravens fly across the screen at random speeds and directions â€” the player must click them to score points before they escape. Includes particle trail effects, explosion animations, and a unique color-based hit detection system using a secondary canvas.

## What I Learned

- Layering multiple canvases for hit detection and rendering separation
- Creating sprite-based object-oriented animations
- Managing particles and explosions using object pools and animation frames
- Using `ctx.globalAlpha` to implement fading visual effects
- Collision detection via pixel color sampling
